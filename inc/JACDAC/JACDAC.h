    /**
     * A JDPkt contains: a crc for error checking, the size of the packet
     * and an address.
     *
     * An address of a packet can be the drivers own address, or another drivers address.
     *
     * Why would you send a packet using your own address? Well, there are a number of different paradigms in JACDAC:
     *
     * 1) Virtual Drivers
     *
     * Virtual drivers allow the virtualisation of a remote resource. Packets produced from the remote resource are
     * consumed as if the remote resource is on the device. An example of this in action would be a remote Accelerometer.
     * Any device can modify the configuration of the remote resource. Only the host of the remote resource is required to be enumerated.
     *
     * 2) Paired Drivers
     *
     * Sharing resources is great, except when you want to own a resource like a joystick. Paired drivers allow ownership
     * over a remote resource. This mode requires both the host and the consumer to enumerated, so that one can tell if
     * the other disappears from the bus and vice versa.
     *
     * 3) Broadcast Drivers
     *
     * Sometimes drivers would like to receive all packets on the bus and do not require the use of addresses. This mode
     * allows any packet addressed to a class to be received. Broadcast drivers can be combined with either mode above,
     * or none at all.
